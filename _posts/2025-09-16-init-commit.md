## Init Commit

The first blog post to *“Dev on the move: exploring healthier habits as a developer.”*  

Did you know that the average software developer spends **65–75% of their day sitting**, often for longer than 30 minutes at a time (CDC study)? And what do most of us do when we finish work? We go straight back to sitting in front of a screen — whether that’s on the sofa watching TV, at our desk hacking on a hobby project, or pitching our latest “Trust me bro, it’s going to make it” startup idea.  

I find it genuinely worrying that I’m spending so much time sat down, most of my life rotting in a chair. Yet, I also love sitting at a desk with my favourite tunes blasting, tapping away at the keyboard writing code (probably bug-ridden).  

So — I’ve decided to **debug my lifestyle** and **refactor my habits** to rediscover health and fitness as a developer. This blog will simply document what I learn along the way.

## The Bugs in My Lifestyle

I’ve been interested in health and fitness since I was young, influenced by my dad’s passion for team sports and individual athletic improvement. Growing up, I took part in running races, a small handful of triathlons, and team sports like Rugby and Basketball. I enjoyed learning how diet and training influence each other.  

But fitness wasn’t my only interest. I was — and still am — captivated by the fact we can convince a computer to do almost anything with tinkering, collaboration, and creativity. That fascination during my teens led me toward a rewarding career, though it’s still relatively young.  

Like many developers, I became single-minded. I let my interest in fitness take a back seat, swapping an active lifestyle for a sedentary one. It wasn’t just the exercise that lagged — diet and sleep also suffered. I often relied on fast food, high-caffeine energy drinks, and late nights at a bright screen (or in the pub).

## Breakpoint

Shortly after starting my career, I regressed further — less movement, worse food, more caffeine. Any attempts at activity were only for a few inconsistent weeks at a time.  

But with a new job, a move to a new city, and living alone in a place where I know almost no one, the conditions have aligned. This life change has finally given me the escape velocity needed to act.  

This blog is the **initial commit** toward leading a healthier life as a developer. I’ll be documenting the bugs, the patches, and the optimisations along the way.  

Like most system logs, I half-expect this blog to go unnoticed and auto-deleted in two weeks. But maybe — if you’ve spotted a bug in your own life — debugging your lifestyle could start here too.
