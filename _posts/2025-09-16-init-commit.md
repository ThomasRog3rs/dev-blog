# Init Commit

The first blog posts to “Dev on the move: exploring healthier habits as a developer” 

Did you know that the average software developer spends **65-75% of their day sitting**, often for longer than 30 minutes at a time ([CDC Study](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0318.htm)). What do most of us do when we finish work? We go straight back to sitting in front of a screen whether that is on the sofa in front of a TV or at our desks working on our next hobby project or the next big start-up we are convincing our friends of with "Trust me bro, this one is going to make it". I find it genuinely worrying that I am spending so much time sat down, most of my life rotting in a chair. Yet, I love sitting at a desk with my favourite tunes blasting, tapping away at the keyboard writing code (probably bug-ridden code). So I've decided to debug my lifestyle and refactor habits to find health and fitness as a software developer, this blog is simply a way for me to document what I learn along the way. 

## The Bugs in my Lifestyle 

I've been interested in health and fitness since I was young, influenced by my dad's passion for team sports and individual athletic improvement. Growing up I took part in various running races, a small handful of triathlons and participated in my fair share of team sports like Rugby & Basketball. I was interested in improving my health with diet and training and how diet and exercise are so interconnected. 

However, fitness was not my only interest. I was, and still am, infatuated by the fact we can convince a computer to do almost anything we need from them with a bit of tinkering, collaborating with others and creativity. This fascination in my teen years led me down a path towards a rewarding and enjoyable career, though that career is still relatively young. 

Like many developers I've crossed paths with, it's easy for us to become single minded, focused on or even obsessed with our principal interest. I was no exception to this, I allowed my interest in fitness to take a back seat and swapped my active lifestyle for a sedentary one. It wasn't just the exercise that lagged behind, my diet and sleep also suffered. I often gorged on easy fast food, high caffeine energy drinks and spent many late nights at a bright screen, clacking away at the keyboard (or in a pub). 

## Breakpoint 

Shortly after starting my career as a software developer I regressed into less and less activity, while my consumption of unhealthy convenience foods and caffeine shot up. If I was ever active, it was only a few weeks at a time with no plan or consistency. 

Getting active again and rewriting my diet from the ground up has been at the back of my mind for a while. I've recently started a shiny new job, moved to a new city, and for the first time am living alone in an area where I know almost no one locally. This fairly drastic life change has given this background thought the escape velocity it needed to become something actionable.  

This blog is the initial commit to leading a healthier life as a developer. I'll be documenting the bugs, the patches and the optimisations I uncover along the way. Like most system logs I expect this blog to go unnoticed and auto-deleted in 2 weeks, but if you spot a bug in your life and need to debug your lifestyle, this might be a good place to start.
